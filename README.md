My first GitHub repo! 10/22/2023 at 2:04am.
Hello Odin!
I went against what Odin said and now I'm making a change through here instead of my local machine. Should I commit changes? 
My thought process says "commit changes, and then go to codium (I use codium over VS Code) and request a "git clone".
It should be as simple as that to get a copy from Github into my local machine, right? Or will it be more complicated than I thought?
I've heard people say coders are LAZY and always find a shortcut to make things easier. I hope I'm right on this one.
